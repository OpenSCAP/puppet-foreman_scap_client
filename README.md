### Sample Usage

The following example ensures that every week an SCAP audit is executed and the results
are sent to proxy at proxy.example.com. The example will automatically attempt to install
foreman_scap_client on the system. If you do not wish to use your tailoring file with policy,
just pass empty string to "tailoring_path".

```puppet
class { foreman_scap_client:
  server           => 'proxy.example.com',
  port             => '8443',
  foreman_repo_rel => '1.14',
  foreman_repo_key => '/net/share/foreman-gpg-rpm-key',
  policies         => [{
    "id"                      => 1,
    "hour"                    => "12",
    "minute"                  => "1",
    "month"                   => "*",
    "monthday"                => "*",
    "weekday"                 => "1",
    "profile_id"              => '',
    "content_path"            => '/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/fedora/ssg-fedora-ds.xml',
    "download_path"           => '/compliance/policies/1/content',
    "tailoring_path"          => '/var/lib/openacap/ssg-fedora-ds-tailored.xml',
    "tailoring_download_path" => "/compliance/policies/1/tailoring"
  }]
}
```

### Usage with foreman_openscap

When using this module together with [foreman_openscap](https://theforeman.org/plugins/foreman_openscap/), no further configuration
 should be necessary as values are by Foreman's ENC. However, verify the values for server, port and policies after
 importing the class; the policies should be `<%= @host.policies_enc %>`

### Releasing on puppet forge

We use project blacksmith to do the release. All you need to do is configuring theforeman
credentials in ~/.puppetforge.yml and then call release task from upstream repo like this

```
bundle exec rake module:release
```
