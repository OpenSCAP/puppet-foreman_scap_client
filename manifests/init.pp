#                     May be overriden if $::rh_certificate_repo_ca_file (from Facter) is found
#
# $host_certificate:: path to host certificate, usually puppet agent certificate
#                     May be overriden if $::rh_certificate_consumer_host_cert (from Facter) is found
#
# $host_private_key:: path to host private key, usually puppet agent private key
#                     May be overriden if $::rh_certificate_consumer_host_key (from Facter) is found
#
# $foreman_repo_rel:: add / manage foreman-plugins yum repo and set to release version. Eg  '1.14'
#
# $foreman_repo_key:: RPM Key source file for foreman-plugins repo. Note: Currently, packages are not signed.
#                     Unless set to an alternative file source, URL will be used.
#
# foreman_repo_src::  Alternative baseurl for The Foreman plugins repository
#
# foreman_repo_gpg_chk:: Enable / disable GPG checks. Directly passed to Yumrepo resource
#
# $policies::         Array of policies that should be configured, each member represent
#                     one policy in form of hash
#                     Policy hash must have following structure
#
#                       { "id" => 1, "hour" => "*", "minute" => "*", "month" => "*",
#                         "monthday" => "*", "weekday" => "*", "profile_id" => '',
#                         "content_path" => '/usr/share/...',
#                         "tailoring_path" => '/var/lib...'
#                       }
#
#                     note that profile_id may be empty (for default profile)
#                     id is number representing id of policy in foreman
#                     content_path is path to DS file that contains profile
#
#                     if it's not array, it's automatically converted to it, so you can
#                     even specify just one policy as a hash
#                     type:array
